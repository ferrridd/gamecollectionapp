    printf("Rock, Paper, Scissors (aka \"Ro-Sham-Bo\"; janken; \"Bato, Bato, Pick\"; and \"Scissors, Paper, Stone\") is a simple hand game with many names and variations. It is played around the world and is commonly used as a way of coming to decisions. In some cases is even played for sport. The rules require that competing players use one hand to form one of three shapes at an agreed-upon time. The person that plays the strongest “object” is the winner of the game. It's that easy! Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple game that anybody can play and win. There is no intrinsic advantage to the stronger, older, or more experienced opponent.\nThink of an issue that needs to be settled. Unless you’re playing for amusement, some issue will normally be hanging in the balance. Maybe you’re trying to decide who gets the last slice of pizza or who should be first in line to try out a new waterslide. In most cases, Rock, Paper, Scissors is played as a means to help make a choice or put an end to a disagreement. The idea is that both players have an equal chance of winning, making the game random but fair. \nPlay one of the three objects against your opponent. When it’s time to play, you and your opponent will each form one of the three objects—either rock, paper or scissors. You’ll then name a winner based on which object they played. Every game will be different, so stay alert! \nAfter you’ve both played an object, look to see who’s won. Each object wins against one shape and loses to another. For instance, rock “crushes” scissors but is “covered” by paper, paper “covers” rock but is “cut” by scissors, and scissors is “crushed” by rock but “cuts” paper. The player who picks the stronger of the two objects is the winner. \nIf both players throw the same object, it’s a tie. In this situation, simply play again until there is a clear winner.\n");
